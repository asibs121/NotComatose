Instead of awakening in her cramped bedroom as she had done every day for the past 23 years of her life, she was instead lying on the ground in this cold, dark crypt, where the only light came from glowing mushrooms. Feeling beneath her legs where she lay, she felt the cool, moist moss coating the rock she lay on. Feeling the earthy, dewy life beneath her confused her even more than her being in a foreign environment. \u201cWhere in the hell am I\u2026\u201d she muttered under her breath, pulling herself to her feet. She found herself dizzy as she felt her way around the cave, feeling the cold cave walls. A feeling overtook her entire body, radiating from her core to her hands and feet- dread. Steadily moving forward, careful not to step into any crevasses, Viktoria made her way through the dark cave, carefully tiptoeing through the hole she had found herself in. Ahead, a glare of rusty red light shone through what looked to be an opening in the cave. Not a big one, she might be able to squeeze her body through the gap. As she drew closer to the wall, a smoky, rotten scent overtook her nostrils, and she began to gag and cough at the stench. Peering through the gap, she could see outside the cave now. A sky full of rumbling storms were cast overhead a forest of what appeared to be burning trees, flames soaring for what seemed like kilometers into the sky. Viktoria pulled herself up and into the nook, barely squeezing her slim body through the narrow gap. Poking her head through, she dropped below, a two-meter drop by her best estimates. It was here where she got her first full glimpse of the world she had entered. Ancient ruins, seemingly thousands of years old still stand tall, dominating the horizon just out of reach from the cave. The air was still hazy, ashes flying everywhere as she began to trek across the rust red grass patches. She couldn\u2019t tell whether that was the natural color or if it had all been killed and stained it the blood red color it currently possessed. \u201cWhat\u2026 the hell\u2026\u201d She gasped, her fear once again sweeping over her. A massive canyon separated her from the towering castle on the horizon, a canyon that seemed to go on forever. The rotten scent became unbearably thick, almost overpowering her lungs from the fumes. A deep, sickening feeling filled her gut as she inhaled the sickly, smoky air. She proceeded forwards, peering over the edge of the canyon. Bodies. Hundreds of thousands of decomposing bodies were thrown around like ragdolls across the massive canyon. Many of which had been decomposed beyond recognition, seemingly been left to rot for weeks. \u201cNo\u2026 No no no no WHAT THE FUCK I\u2026I\u2026\u201d She broke down, her legs collapsing beneath her at the horrendous sight. Clawing as far from the canyon as she could, she shook violently. Convulsing from fear, she vomited, sobbing in between hurls. She slowly crawled away from the sight, back towards her cave where she leaned up against the stone and sobbed. Her cries were muffled by thunderous roars of an oncoming storm. The sun, or suns rather began to set in the horizon. She knew she had to get to her feet and be strong, but the number of bodies strewn across the canyon, thrown violently into the stream that ran at the bottom, it was too much for her fragile mind to take. Her despair was interrupted by a slight buzzing, accompanied by a humming noise coming from the distance. Pulling herself up to her feet, barely keeping her balance, she grabbed a rock and backed away into a nook. The humming stopped, but the buzz drew closer, and eventually a floating mechanical orb peered at the horrified woman before it. Veronika screamed loudly, brandishing the rock over her head ready to throw. Before she could, however, two wiry mechanical arms sprung from the machine, and it held them up in front of its face as if to say it meant no harm to her. She lowered the stone, breathing heavily at this point. \u201cDack\u2019shuma?\u201d it had said, rotating as if to tilt its head. \u201cW-What?\u201d She stammered, lowering the rock slightly. It took a minute, but the machine finally responded, \u201cWho you are?\u201d It\u2019s voice was cold and robotic, but genuine as it calmly floated before Veronika. \u201cVeronika\u2026 Who are you?\u201d She stammered in response. \u201cAm Unit 312. You are aware, speaking extinct language?\u201d \u201cExtinct language? What do you mean? What year is it, where am I?\u201d Veronika dropped the rock and began to weep again, sliding down the cliff facing. \u201cDo not cry Human, Unit 312 is friend\u201d It spoke, slowly moving towards her. She didn\u2019t bother fighting, if this was how she was to die, she wanted to just succumb to her fate already. Much to her surprise, however, Unit 312 merely used its mechanical arm to lightly scratch her back, instantly soothing her. \u201cYou are in Tessere, formerly colonized by Human. But now graveyard. Unit 312 was built by human, in last days of war. But hope was lost, as world was killed. You came from Earth, Yes?\u201d The being spoke, once again tilting its head. \u201cY-yes. Albania.\u201d Veronika hesitantly spoke, glaring into the glassy eye of Unit 312. \u201cAlbania? Albania fell thousand years back, year 2026. Human now all belong as one, all belong to Terran Union. Speak Terran.\u201d Her mind shuttered at this. Albania was gone? What sick dream was this? All of it was much too real to be a dream, the vivid scent, the rotted bodies below the canyon. Hell, even Unit 312 had been far beyond what she\u2019d be capable of dreaming. The future, had she been in the future? How would she travel forwards in time like that, it didn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cHow can I get home?\u201d Veronika asked, glaring into the eyes of Unit 312. Her tear-soaked face reflected off the glossy surface of the AI. She noticed her hair tangled and knotted. \u201cAfraid we must escape Tessere first. Then long journey, weeks. But demons not allow escape.\u201d Veronika got back on her feet, feeling nauseous, but slightly better than before. All she wanted was answers, and while she still felt sick to her stomach, she knew no answers would come through sitting and crying, as much as every muscle in her body wanted to. Unit 312 hadn\u2019t done anything to harm her yet and seemed like it wanted to help however it could. \u201cI think I need to find some supplies to survive, can you stay with me?\u201d Veronika asked the machine. Veronika smiled, wiping the tears from her eyes, as she walked away from her nook, Unit 312 trailing behind her. Maybe she had a chance after all in this strange world.","title":"Chapter 1"},{"location":"chap2/","text":"Chapter 2 11/7/18 One week ago, Viktoria had suddenly awoken on Tessere, a steamy, dark, dreary world, a world formerly of valleys, rivers, towering cities and prosperity. She had learned through Unit 312 however that this all came to a crashing end around a month ago. She was no longer in the year 2026, rather the year 3041. Humanity had long transcended from its cradle on Earth, soaring through the stars, forming a galaxy wide empire. The human population was estimated to be approaching one trillion individuals spread across the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud, rising rapidly each day. Old Earth languages had long since faded away into memory, spoken only by a few stubborn rural areas of the most isolated colonies in the galaxy. However, 10 years ago, Humanity had awoken something, a race only known as Demons. Despite the vastness of the galaxy, this was humanities first encounter with intelligent life beyond that of their own making. A far-off world in the Large Magellanic Cloud, known to many as Golgotha, a barren red desert with small patches of lifeforms scattered across the wasteland. Ruined cities, hundreds of thousands of years old were scattered across the world. When the first Human colony ships had landed, the skies quickly blackened and red tinted skies overtook the region. As the settlers tried to escape, their ships were sent hurtling into the mountains, seemingly possessed by paranormal forces. The last survivors sent a transmission warning never to return to the world, documenting what had happened. Before the transmission ended, loud screams, emanating from a creature, a demon, bellowed, as the last of the colonists were quickly slaughtered. Viktoria had spent the last week learning of all this information, aided by Unit 312. Uni, her nickname for Unit 312, had been learning to speak Albanian more fluently, picking up on Viktoria\u2019s mannerisms and structure. The distant castle beyond the deathly canyon had been stocked with food, and as she discovered was the centerpiece of a theme park. A small military base located a block away had supplies of armor and rifles, untouched from the invaders. Veronika had learned of Uni\u2019s past, constructed about 5 years ago to interact and help Tesserians in the event of a demon invasion. The invasion came, but it was far too massive for Uni and her fellow AI\u2019s to contain. Millions of people were killed in the onslaught, many thrown into pits such as the one Veronika had the misfortune of encountering. Veronika told Uni her upbringing, speaking wonders of her past, life in her home country, her 4 siblings and family. She wanted to see them again so badly, but she knew she couldn\u2019t. Not yet. Her life as a bartender was boring, but it gave her money so she did it. For the time being, everything was calm. No demons had been encountered, and Veronika had been able to scavenge for various tools, even a suit of armor she found. Steadily, she had been building endurance to run faster, farther, hit harder. She was preparing to fight for her life in an environment that no human had survived. The demons were capable of killing billions of people, but Veronika was determined not to be among them. From nowhere, the sounds of crying echoed from overhead. Deafeningly loud distant crying, almost as though the skies were the source of the despair. Her rifle made sparks as it dragged along the stone, Veronika holding the rifle in her arms with near perfect form. She had to give Uni credit, for a machine it knew how to train a fighter in short time. Stepping outside the ruined hut she and Uni had lived in the past week, she began to recognize the sounds. Uni began speaking, but she ignored it. Her sister. Those tears were her sisters. She began to speak, \u201cVeronika, if you can hear me, just know that we love you, we love you so much. Just wake up. Please\u2026\u201d Another voice, this time an unfamiliar one. \u201cGiven we don\u2019t know what had happened, we can\u2019t be sure of when she will wake up. Besides being unable to wake up, we believe she is perfectly healthy. Analyzing her mental activities shown she\u2019s been under a great deal of stress, especially the first few days, but\u2026\u201d the voices faded. \u201cNo, Lara? LARA! I CAN HEAR YOU! Please! Please\u2026\u201d Veronika screamed to the looming clouds overhead. More tears ran down her face. She had lost all emotions since the first night, and the pressing reminder than her family needed her left her shattered even more than she already was. She fell to her knees, dropping the rifle to the ground. \u201cVeronika, what is it? You must remain silent, they may hear you!\u201d Uni spoke from behind her. Veronika stopped, staring at the skies waiting for a response to her cries, but none came. \u201cMy... My sister, I heard her\u2026 I think, I\u2019m in a coma?\u201d She furiously began pinching herself, only to find that she felt every grasp at her own skin. If she wasn\u2019t dreaming, then what was that? \u201cUni, what is happening to me?\u201d She asked, staring into Uni\u2019s single eye. \u201cI cannot say for sure. From what I have learned from you, you aren\u2019t from this time, as your primary language has been extinct for centuries. Logically, you shouldn\u2019t even exist in this time period.\u201d Uni\u2019s words did not bring Veronika comfort, because no amount of logic could explain her being where she is. And even if it could, there\u2019s no reason she should hear her family weeping over her comatose body, back in Albania, a thousand years ago. Her mind tore itself apart for answers, but none came to her. She pulled herself together, just as a distant roar echoed from the forest. \u201cOh this is bad\u201d Uni warned, \u201cThey know we are here!\u201d","title":"Chapter 2"}]}
